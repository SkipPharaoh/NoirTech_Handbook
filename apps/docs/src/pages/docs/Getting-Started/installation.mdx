# Installation

How to install dependencies and structure your app.

## TypeScript

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

## React

This project is built with [React](https://react.dev/). You can use it with any React project.

<Steps>

### Create project

Ensure you have a React project set up and ready to go. If you don't, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://react.dev/learn/installation).

### Run the CLI

Run the `@noirtribe/ui` command to add the UI components to your project:

```bash copy
pnpm add @noirtribe/ui
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers copy
import { Button } from "@noirtribe/ui";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
