# Coding Standards

For coding standards, cover things like naming conventions, code organization, file structure, commenting, testing approaches, etc.

What are the coding standards and guidelines you want to establish? Discuss topics like code formatting, naming conventions, code organization, and best practices.

Are there any specific language or framework-specific conventions that should be followed? For example, how should TypeScript or Next.js code be structured?

Are there any guidelines for using third-party libraries or frameworks? Specify any restrictions, recommendations, or patterns you want to enforce.

How should documentation be written and maintained? Explain the preferred format, style, and standards for documenting code and APIs.

Are there any testing or quality assurance requirements? Outline the expectations for unit tests, integration tests, code reviews, and quality checks.
